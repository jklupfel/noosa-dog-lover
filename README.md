The Sunshine Coast has 49416 registered dogs, but no easy way for dog owners to locate dog parks, off leash beach areas, dog friendly water fountains or areas where dogs are prohibited. This is even more difficult for the 8.2 million visitors each year.

Hi, we are Jay, Pat and Johannes, and we’ve build the first extensive Sunshine Coast Dog App (including Brisbane and Gold Coast).

Our app allows dog lovers to find off leash, on leash beaches and parks, as well as prohibited areas, locate water fountains including dog bowls and has potential for additional integrations and monetisation.

We’ve used Data from 
* Noosa Council Beach Access Points
* Noosa registered dogs
* Sunshine Coast Council Beach Access Points
* Sunshine Coast water taps
* Brisbane parks and facilities assets
* Noosa name and breeds

normalised the data to find most relevant information for dog owners.
We used Google Maps API, 
code igniter
bootstrap 
jquery
fontawesome

to display the information in a visually appealing way.

80% of dog owners that we interviewed would use this app, and would be willing to pay up to $5 for it.

The app itself is quite simple to use. Open the app, select list or map view and we will show you the distance to the nearest……...
You can filter by …….. ……. …… to only show relevant listings.

Additional features that could be added are
a rating system that allows users to rate each locations and give feedback
Facebook Integration, that allows user to check in to a location and connect with other dog lovers
adding commercial data feeds such as cafes, pet shops, dog cleaning services
in app ads
